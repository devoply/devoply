# DEVOPly PHP Developer Platform


DEVOPly is an Open Source local development and remote hosting platform for PHP applications. WordPress, Drupal, and any PHP Framework using composer.

## Open Source vs Pro version

The open source version lacks a number of features included in the pro version.
* Support for GIT deployment.
* Backup using a number of cloud providers.
* Cloning a website between different servers.
* (todo) Deploying a redundant HA server with multiple copies of live sites.

Locally you can start DEVOPLy by installing Docker and running a command. You can use a local instance to manage remote VPS servers. However do not that the data on your local machine may be lost and therefore access to existing sites will be lost if your local container is destroyed. Therefore, we do no recommend running a production instance of DEVOPly locally.

# Supported Platforms
* Mac
* Linux
* Windows

# Configuration

In order to deploy DEVOPly you will need an Amazon AWS account and you will incur small charges for using various features needed by DEVOPly. These include Amazon SQS, Amazon SNS, Amazon SES, etc.

# Technical Support Packages

Technical support is offered at $50/hr. with a 3 hour minimum purchase ($150). This includes installing, upgrading, and debugging any hosting issue. A technical support package is valid for one year. A pro license does not include a technical support package, only access to the current software and the ability to file bugs.

# Sponsorships

Sponsorships help fund this open source project. They will give you access to an expert resource as well as the source of the professional version. We can help you develop a commercial offering for customers built on top of the professional or open source versions of DEVOPly using an enterprise file system such as ZFS or GlusterFS with potential for redundant copies of the same site in case any of the servers in your network fail.
